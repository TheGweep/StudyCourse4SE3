height="123"><br>
<font size="2">PLATINUM BP<i>win</i> is a powerful modeling tool used to analyze,
document, and improve complex business processes. A BP<i>win</i> model lets you clearly
document important factors such as what activities are needed, how they are performed, and
what resources are needed. This provides an integrated picture of how your organization
gets things done, from small department workflow models to complex node tree diagrams. And
if you are building or purchasing software, business process models serve as excellent
requirements documentation, helping to ensure that your IT investments fulfill business
needs. A business's complex processes often require teams of analysts, and PLATINUM
provides the environment to help. BP<i>win</i> is scalable to support enterprise business
models through its integration with PLATINUM ModelMart, the industry-leading model
management system. And, BP<i>win</i> process models can be synchronized with PLATINUM ER<i>win</i>
data models, allowing you to verify that your information resources optimally support your
business processes. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Optimize Processes and Information with Business
Strategy</b></font><br>
BP<i>win</i> models provide the framework for understanding your business processes,
determining the impact of business events and defining how your processes interact with
the data flowing through your organization. Inefficient, wasteful, or redundant activities
can be easily detected — and subsequently improved, replaced, or eliminated — in
accordance with your corporate objectives. <br>

&nbsp;<br>
An external force on an organization often causes change. The impact of the change must be
fully understood and communicated before a system can be designed to accommodate it. BP<i>win</i>
can help you throughout this cycle by allowing you to design the optimized business
process that encompasses the change. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Enjoy Powerful, Easy-to-Use Process Modeling</b></font><br>
With BP<i>win</i>, you can be productive almost immediately. Activities and other common
objects can be created with a few mouse clicks, and relocated with drag-and-drop ease. BP<i>win</i>'s
&quot;explorer&quot; facility makes navigating and editing complex hierarchical process
models easier than ever. Enhanced zooming capabilities allow a user to quickly focus on
the portion of a process model on which they need to work. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
BP<i>win</i> automates many of the housekeeping tasks usually associated with building
process models and provides the logical rigor needed to ensure correct and consistent
results. BP<i>win</i> maintains arrow associations across diagrams, so they remain
consistent as your model changes. Dynamic object highlighting guides you as you build your
model, and prevents you from making many common modeling mistakes. In addition, BP<i>win</i>
supports User Defined Properties that let you capture information relevant to your needs. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In addition, flexible font, color, and other presentation options give your documents more
impact. You can view and print an overview of your model using node tree diagrams.
Variations in design or problem areas can be explored without committing changes to the
core model using For Exposition Only (FEO) diagrams. User-defined color palettes offer you
the ability to easily fine-tune your output to match the capabilities of your printer or
projection system without changing the model. <br>
&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Using BP<i>win</i>, you build a diagram that clearly shows business activities, their
results, and the resources needed to support them. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Understand Your Business from Multiple Perspectives</b></font><br>
BP<i>win</i> supports function, dataflow, and workflow modeling in one tool, integrating
three key business perspectives to serve the needs of both business and technology
analysts. With function modeling, you can systematically analyze your business, focusing
on the tasks (functions) that are performed regularly, the controls that exist to ensure
they are performed properly, the resources needed to perform a task, the results of a task
and the inputs (raw materials) on which the task operates. Dataflow modeling, which is
often used in software design, focuses on the flow of data between various tasks,
including how data must be stored to maximize availability and minimize response times.
Workflow modeling focuses on a particular process, analyzing the individual tasks
involved, and the decisions that affect its progress. <br>

analysts. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Benefit from Flexible Scoping of Models</b></font><br>
Business process models can be very large if you're looking at an enterprise view of your
organization. BP<i>win</i> has facilities to assist you in incremental development and
scoping of process models. Its merge capabilities allow multiple design groups to analyze
separate parts of the business, so a global view can be easily created. Similarly,
sometimes it is more efficient to look at a defined part of a larger view. BP<i>win</i>
allows you to split off pieces of the model, work on them, and then reintegrate them back
into the whole. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<img src="b_bpwin3.gif" alt="Diagram" width="474" height="356"><br>
&nbsp;<br>
BP<i>win</i> provides numerous ways to represent business processes so that all involved
with the modeling process can provide their unique perspective. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Analyze Cost and Performance Metrics</b></font><br>
BP<i>win</i> provides full support for activity-based costing (ABC), and is optimized for
process analysis. Comprehensive reporting and a bi-directional interface with dedicated
ABC tools makes it easier for companies to implement an activity-based management
strategy. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Reuse Models with Simulation Interface for Dynamic
Modeling</b></font><br>
For complex operational environments, BP<i>win</i> offers an interface to simulation
software that lets you reuse your BP<i>win</i> models to explore the time varying
(dynamic) interactions of your business processes. Resource allocations and process flows
can then be optimized to meet your target workloads. Simulation provides the ability to
explore the effect of change dynamically. Different scenarios can be tested before change
is implemented, ensuring an optimal solution to a business requirement. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Scale to the Enterprise with ModelMart</b></font><br>
Designing processes that span the enterprise often requires teams of people working
together. ModelMart supports BP<i>win</i> designers by providing the ability to
concurrently share and update the same models. It gives users security, check-in,
check-out, versioning, and change management facilities that are critical to workgroup or
enterprise-wide process modeling efforts. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
ModelMart provides physical storage of BP<i>win</i> model information in a variety of
relational database management systems. Easy to set up and maintain, ModelMart is platform
and network independent to easily integrate into your existing environment. <br>
&nbsp;<br>

BP<i>win</i> integrates with PLATINUM ModelMart, the industry-leading model management
system. Among its many facilities, ModelMart provides change control management so that
individuals can see the impact of their work. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Synchronize Process Models with Data Models</b></font><br>
A unique aspect of BP<i>win</i> is its ability to verify that your information
architecture optimally supports your business processes. BP<i>win</i> features a
bi-directional synchronization with PLATINUM's award-winning ER<i>win</i> database design
tool. Use BP<i>win</i> to further validate the quality and consistency of your ER<i>win</i>
data models, capture important detail about how and where the data is being used, and make
sure that the right information is available when and where it is needed. This integration
ensures that new distributed and data warehouse systems actually support your business
requirements. The exchange of modeling information between BP<i>win</i> and ER<i>win</i>
is further facilitated with ModelMart so that entity and attribute information can be
synchronized as a dynamic part of business process modeling. Information introduced as
part of this synchronization can be managed with ModelMart's comprehensive change
management, impact analysis, and reporting capabilities. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font size="4" color="#333366"><b>Communicate Effectively Through Model Publishing</b></font><br>
Developers, analysts, and end users can communicate effectively with PLATINUM Model
Navigator, a companion product to BP<i>win</i> and ER<i>win</i>. Model Navigator provides
dynamic, read-only access to models, as well as full reporting capabilities. <br>
