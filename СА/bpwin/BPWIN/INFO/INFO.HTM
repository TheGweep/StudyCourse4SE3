<b>Description:</b><br>
PLATINUM BP<i>win</i> is a powerful modeling tool used to analyze, document, and improve
complex business processes. For example, using a BP<i>win</i> model you can clearly
document which activities are needed, how they are performed, and what resources are
required. This provides an integrated picture of how your organization gets things done
— from small department workflow models to complex node tree diagrams. If you are
building or purchasing software, business process models also serve as requirements
documentation, helping to ensure that your IT investments fulfill business needs. BP<i>win</i>
models help you understand business processes and the impact of business events, and
define how business processes interact with your data. Inefficient, wasteful or redundant
activities can be easily detected — and subsequently improved, replaced or eliminated
— to help you meet corporate objectives. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
BP<i>win</i> is scalable to support enterprise business models through its integration
with PLATINUM ModelMart, a model management system. BP<i>win</i> process models can be
synchronized with PLATINUM ER<i>win</i> data models, allowing you to verify that your
information resources optimally support your business processes. <br>
